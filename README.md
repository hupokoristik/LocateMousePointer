# LocateMousePointer

This message is for a respected individual.  I hope he enjoys it.

When using multiple monitors, it can be difficult sometimes to locate one's mouse pointer.

In Windows, there's a cool hotkey setting that puts a sort-of beacon around the mouse pointer, upon demand.

Happy mousing!
